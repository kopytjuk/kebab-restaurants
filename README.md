Kebab restaurant analysis

I always was interested whether the number of Kebab restaurants in my town (which is huge, you'll understand the assumtion after take a walk in the center of the city). 
I grabbed GMAPs Places API, queried various places and did some calculations on number of Kebab restaurants nearby (i.e. 100m, 500m, etc.)

See the notebooks for details. Run [getter.ipynb](data-getter.ipynb) to generate data.
